# DevelopingDataProducts_Project

A simple shiny app for predicting and visulizating a child high with the parent hight. The predicting model bases on *galton* embeded data set.

To run this application:

* download this repo
* change working directory to this which contains *ui.R* and *server.R*
* run `runApp()`
* use a slider to change parent hight
